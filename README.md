Enables browsing twitter without account or being logged in --- a "feature" that was introduced sometime in the summer of 2021. It does this by hiding the annoying "Log in / Sign up" prompt when it pops up. When it hides the popup it will also hide the blue banner on the bottom of the screen, which is there to also convince you to login, and the "enable cookies" prompt. Made for people who only occasionally use twitter to check on a specific account for updates and the like.

This extension might not work properly if used when logged in.
